# Streamlit Tumor Spatial Data Visualization App

This Streamlit application is designed to provide an interactive visualization of tumor 
spatial data. It focuses on the immunologic environment from biopsy samples,
allowing users to gain insights into the cellular composition and interactions within 
the tumor microenvironment. Main goal of this project is to locate Tertiary lymphoid 
structures (TLS) within analyzed tissue
